## The Java Advanced: Backend Services [2024 Q1 VS Group]

### Module 1 Homework

#### Task 1 - Spring Configuration
- Create Basic Spring application which will have Data Source configuration provided by spring Configuration (2 points):
- Introduce a configuration(using @Configuration) which should have a method annotated with @Bean which returns a configured data source instance. 
- Use https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.h2database/h2 as a Data Source. 
- Add test which tests your application by saving an entity to the data source(@DataJpaTest/@DataJdbcTest).

#### Task 2 - Conditional Configuration
- Adjust existing configuration for Data Source based on conditional properties (2 points):
- Custom Data Source should be optionally enabled or disabled based on a configuration property (@ConditionalOnProperty). 
- Enable the custom Data Source if the property is set to true or missing.
- (Optional) Disable the custom Data Source and discover which Auto Configuration is responsible for creating a default Data source.

#### Task 3 - Spring Profiles
- Separate Data Source Configurations using Profiles (2 points):
- Create a configuration files for two environments (local, dev). 
- Define database connection properties (url, username, password) in each file. 
- Create additional configuration file for test profile (under /test/java/resources folder). 
- Adjust test from the Task 1 to use Data Source configured from test configuration file(@DataJpaTest/@DataJdbcTest + @AutoConfigureTestDatabase(replace = NONE)).

#### Task 4 - Spring Actuator
- Enable actuator by adding https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.boot/spring-boot-starter-actuator dependency. (1 point)
- Expose Default Spring Actuator by configuring SecurityFilterChain/SecurityWebFilterChain bean. (1 point)
- Check OOTB actuator endpoints (using /actuator). 
- Add a new custom actuator endpoint(using @Component and @Endpoint(id = ...)) to return active profile and current DB url. (2 points)
- Only 2 endpoints (/health and custom endpoint above) should be exposed. Apply these changes for both environments (local and dev) by using a base configuration file.
